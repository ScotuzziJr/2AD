# _Another Day, Another Distro (2AD)_

**2AD** is an API developed as a study case of FastAPI, a Python framework for API development. 

My squad had a problem choosing a Python framework to develop API's, resulting in projects developed using Django and others using Flask. So we created a POC hoping to achieve a standard in API's implementation. 

This doc describes the process of development using FastAPI and explains the base structure of the project, so it can be used as a scaffold in further implementations.
